Hello! Welcome to first part of the assembling XGlass glasses.

# Motherboard
So first you need a motherboard.I think Orange Pi Zero 2W will be best. 

If you found a board better just send issue.
There are 4 types of OPi: 1gb RAM, 1.5GB RAM, 2GB RAM and 4GB RAM.You must selec
t one that you will like.

# Display
The second thing is displa. So you need small display but max is your glasses si
ze.I recomend taking smaller (you can adjust size with magnifier like me).
Oled, LCD, IPS, TFT it's all various. You must select that you like.

# Camera
Camera is important thing too. On video from camera we can find our position, ar
ms for control, controllers and other things.
I'm recomending take camera on 5-13MP. 
* !!VERY INPORTANT TO TAKE WEBCAMERA FROM LAPTOP!! *

# Gyroscope
This is important part too. On it's values glasses can recognize it's rotation.
I taken MPU6050 and recommend it.

For now that's all important parts
TODO: speaker, vibration motor, microphone, etc
